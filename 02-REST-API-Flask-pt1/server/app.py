# 2.✅ Initialize the Api

# 3.✅ Create a Production class that inherits from Resource
class Productions(Resource):
    # 4.✅ Create a GET all route
    # 4.1 Make a get method that takes self as a param
    def get(self):
        # ipdb.set_trace()
        # 4.2 Create a productions array.
        # 4.3 Make a query for all productions. For every production in productions make a dictionary from the production with all of it's attributes. append the dictionary to the productions array.
        # productions_list = [
        #     {

        #     }
        #     for production in Production.query.all()
        # ]
        # 4.4 Create a response variable and set it to:
        #      make_response(
        #         jsonify(productions),
        #         200
        #     )
        # 4.5 return the response
        # return make_response(productions_list, 200)

        # 4.6 After building the route run the server and test it in the browser
        # 4.7 ✅ Add the new route to our api with api.add_resource (see below post)

        # 5.✅ Serialization
        # This is great, but there's a cleaner way to do this with Serialization that will allow us to easily add our associations as well.
        # Navigate to models.py for Steps 6 - 9

        # 10.✅ Use our serializer to format our response to be cleaner
        # 10.1 Query all of the productions, convert them to a dictionary with to_dict and set them to a list.
        productions_list = [
            production.to_dict() for production in Production.query.all()
        ]
        # 10.2 Invoke make_response, pass it the production list and a status of 200. Set make_response to a response variable.
        # 10.3 return the response variable
        return make_response(productions_list, 200)

    # 10.4 After building the route run the server and test it in the browser

    # 11.✅ Create a POST route
    # Prepare a POST request in Postman under the Body tab select form-data and fill out the body of a production request.
    # Create the POST route
    # 📚 Review With Students: request object
    # 11.1 create a post method and pass it self.
    def post(self):
        request_json = request.get_json()
        # ipdb.set_trace()
        # 11.2 create a new production from the request.json object.
        new_production = Production(
            title=request_json["title"],

            image=request_json["image"],
            director=request_json["director"],
            description=request_json["description"],
            ongoing=request_json["ongoing"],
        )
        # 11.3 add and commit the new production
        db.session.add(new_production)
        db.session.commit()

        # 11.4 convert the new production to a dictionary with to_dict
        # 11.5 Set make_response to a response variable and pass it the new production and a status of 201
        return make_response(new_production.to_dict(), 201)

    # 11.6 Test the route in postman


# 12.✅ If not done above, add the new route to our api with api.add_resource
api.add_resource(Productions, "/productions")


# 13.✅ Create a GET one route
# 13.1 Build a class called ProductionByID that inherits from Resource.
class ProductionById(Resource):
    # 13.2 Create a get method and pass it the id along with self. (This is how we will gain access to the id from our request)
    def get(self, id):
        # 13.3 Make a query for our production by the id and build a response to send to the browser.
        production = Production.query.get(id)
        if not production:
            return make_response("Requested production not found", 404)
        return make_response(production.to_dict(), 200)


# 14.✅ Add the new route to our api with api.add_resource
api.add_resource(ProductionById, "/productions/<int:id>")

# The example below show the Production index and create routes WITHOUT flask_restful

# @app.route("/productions", methods=["GET", "POST"])
# def productions():
#     if request.method == "POST":
#         request_json = request.get_json()
#         # ipdb.set_trace()
#         new_production = Production(
#             title=request_json["title"],
#             genre=request_json["genre"],
#             budget=request_json["budget"],
#             image=request_json["image"],
#             director=request_json["director"],
#             description=request_json["description"],
#             ongoing=request_json["ongoing"],
#         )
#         db.session.add(new_production)
#         db.session.commit()

#         return make_response(new_production.to_dict(), 201)
# else:
#    ...logic from Productions.get above to query all Productions, etc...
